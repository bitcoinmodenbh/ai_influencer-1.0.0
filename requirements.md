   - Lightning Network
   - Nostr
   - Online privacy
   - Bitcoin security
   - Setting up Bitcoin and Lightning nodes
   - Maintaining privacy for nodes
   - Running Nostr relays
   - Related cryptocurrency topics
3. Include 15 relevant hashtags with each post
4. Generate and publish a related image with each post

### API Integration
1. Connect to the Twitter API using user-provided credentials
2. Authenticate securely with the API
3. Post text content to the platform
4. Upload and attach images to posts
5. Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully

### User Interface
1. Provide a graphical interface for managing API credentials
2. Display execution status of the automated posting system
3. Store and display history of published tweets
4. Allow configuration of posting schedule
5. Provide options to customize content generation parameters

## Technical Requirements

### Development
1. Implement the system in Python
2. Use appropriate libraries for:
   - Twitter API integration
   - Content generation
   - Image generation
   - GUI development
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Ensure secure storage of API credentials

### Performance
1. Operate reliably on a 24-hour schedule
2. Minimize API usage to avoid rate limiting
3. Optimize image generation for reasonable performance
